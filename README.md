# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection using Linear Regression

A machine learning project to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a Linear Regression model, designed as a learning initiative to experiment with unconventional algorithms for classification tasks.

## 📌 Overview

Fraudulent credit card transactions are a growing threat in the digital economy. This project explores how **Linear Regression**, a regression-based algorithm, can be applied and evaluated in a binary classification context. Despite not being the typical choice (compared to Logistic Regression or Tree-based models), this approach helps understand the boundaries and assumptions of models in real-world data applications.
